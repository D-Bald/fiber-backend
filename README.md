## Usage

You can run this package on its own by setting the [.env](https://github.com/D-Bald/fiber-backend/blob/master/.env.sample) accordingly, for exapmle with a Atlas hosted MongoDB Cluster (the *.env* file variables are used by both the docker-compose and the fiber-backend), but using the [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/D-Bald/fiber-backend/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml) is the easiest way to deploy all dependencies on a server.

Follow these steps:
1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
2. Download *.env* file from the [.env.sample](https://github.com/D-Bald/fiber-backend/blob/master/.env.sample) file
    ```shell
    $ sudo wget -O .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D-Bald/fiber-backend/main/.env.sample
    ```
3. Set the `DB_HOST` variable in the *.env* file to the name of the docker service (in this [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/D-Bald/fiber-backend/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml) the service is named `mongodb`). If you use a Atlas hosted MongoDB database, set this variable to `ATLAS`. Also check environment variables like ports, database name, user and passwor and PLEASE change `SECRET` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
4. Download the *docker-compose.yaml* file
    ```shell
    $ sudo wget -O docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D-Bald/fiber-backend/main/docker-compose.yaml
    ```
5. Execute the following commands in the root directory of [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/D-Bald/fiber-backend/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml):
    - To get the containers up and running execute:
        ```shell
        $ docker-compose up -d
        ```
    - To stop the containers execute:
        ```shell
        $ docker-compose down -v
        ```

This setup will create and start three docker containers:
 - [mongo](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/)
 - [mongo-express](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo-express)
 - [fiber-backend](https://github.com/D-Bald/fiber-backend)

The data is persistent over multiple `up` and `down` cycles using [docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/compose/#preserve-volume-data-when-containers-are-created).<br>
Check the database setup with [mongo-express](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo-express) on `http://localhost:8081`.

|                          | `DELETE`  | &check;                     | `result`                     | Delete user with id `id`.<br> Specify userÂ´s password in the request body.   |
| `/api/contenttypes`      | `GET`     | &cross;                     | `contenttype`                | Return all content types present in the `contenttypes` collection. |
|                          | `POST`    | &check; (admin)             | `contenttype`                | Create a new content type.<br> Specify the following attributes in the request body: `typename`, `collection`, `field_schema`.   |

By convention this should be plural of the `typename`.<br> For the previous example: `content` has to be set to `events`.   |
|                          | `POST`    | &check; (admin)             | `content`                    | Create a new content entry of the content type, where `content` is the corresponding collection.<br> Specify the following attributes in the request body: `title` (string), `published`(bool), `fields`(key-value pairs: field name - field value). |

|                          | `DELETE`  | &check; (admin)             | `result`                     | Delete content entry with id `id` of the content type, where `content` is the corresponding collection.   |

<sup>*</sup> `status` and `message` are returned on every request.

## Workflows
### Roles

The Roles *user* and *admin* are preset with weights 0 and 1000. If you delete them, they will be recreated on the next start, but the weights can be manipulated persistently. The role *user* is assigned to every user on creation.<br>
Just one `GET` endpoint exists, which returns all roles. There is no use for the data of a singe role.<br>
The `PATCH` and `DELETE` endpoints take `role` as query filter. This means only the `weight` field can be updated. Otherwise delete the old role and create a new one. Weights and rolenames are unique.<br>
Example JSON request body:
```json
// POST or PATCH
{
    "role":"moderator",
    "weight":2
}
// DELETE
{
    "role":"moderator"
}
```

### Create content and content types

The content types *event* and *blogpost* are preset and you can start adding entries on those routes (`/api/events` or `/api/blogposts`). Events have custom fields *description* and *date* whereas blogposts come with *description* and *text*. By convention the collection should be plural of the typename.
If you want to create a custom content type, first use the `/api/contenttypes` endpoint, because the `/api/:content` route is validated by a lookup in the `contenttypes` collection. The mongoDB collections for new types are created automatically on first content insertion.<br>
The last attribute for a new content type, *field_schema*, is a list of key-value pairs specifying name and type of fields, that an content entry of this content type should have.<br>
Exapmle JSON request body:
```json
{
    "typename": "protected-admin-test",
    "collection": "protected-admin-test-entries",
    "permissions": {
        "delete": [
            "admin"
        ],
        "get": [
            "admin"
        ],
        "patch": [
            "admin"
        ],
        "post": [
            "admin"
        ]
    }
    "field_schema": {
        "text_field": "string"
    }
}
```

The last attribute for a new content entry, *fields* is a list of key-value pairs specifying name and value of fields, that should match the *field_schema* of the corresponding content type. **A validation is not yet implemented.** <br>
Example JSON request body:
```json
{
    "title": "Blogpost Test",
    "published": false,
    "tags": [
        "foo",
        "bar"
    ],
    "fields": {
        "description": "Hello world",
        "date": "2021-04-08T12:00:00+02:00"
    }
}
```

### Update content entries

To update custom fields you have to specify it as nested object in the request body.<br>
Example JSON request body:
```json
{ "fields": {"description": "foo bar"} }
```

Preset fields can be reached directly. Example JSON request body:
```json
{
    "tags": ["foo", "bar"],
    "published": true
}
```


### Create users

The admin user *adminUser* is preset with the password `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from the [.env](https://github.com/D-Bald/fiber-backend/blob/master/.env.sample) file in the root direcory of the executable.
Anybody can create a new user. The role is automatically set to *user*.<br>
Example JSON request body:
```json
{
    "username": "TestUser",
    "email": "unique@mail.com",
    "password":"123",
    "names":"names",
}
```

### Update users

A user can edit the own data i.e. *username*, *email*, *password*, *names*.
Every user with role *admin* can edit any other user and particularly can edit the field *role* of any user. Roles must be updated as array containing all roles as single strings.<br>
Example JSON request body:
```json
{
    "username": "John Doe",
    "roles": ["user","admin"]
}
```

### Query users and content entries by route parameters

To get all Users or all content entries of one content type, just use the bare API `GET` endpoint (example 1). To search for Users and content entries with certain properties, a query string can be added to the API endpoint. The query string begins with `?`. Each search parameter has the structure `key=value` and is case sensitive. Each document has a unique ID, that can be used to query for a single result (example 2). Multiple parameters are seperated by `&` (example 3). Custom fields of content entries can be queried directly so **don't** use dot-notation or similar (example 4). Only the whole field value is matched, so submatches are not supported. Queries for single elements of array fields like 'tags' are possible (example 5). In queries with multiple array elements, the query values currently have to have the same order as in the database and can not be a subset of the stored ones(example 6). Therefore queries with single values are recommended.<br>
Examples:
```markdown
# 1
/api/events
# 2
/api/user?id=609273e9f17aa49bcd126418
# 3.
/api/blogposts?title=Title&published=false
# 4.
/api/events?place=home
# 5.
/api/blogposts?tags=foo
# 6.
/api/events?tags=foo,bar
```
Example 6 currently only returns documents with a full match on tags like:
```json
{ "tags": ["foo", "bar"] }
```

## TO DO
- Edit `DELETE` handler/controller for contenttypes and roles, so that effected content is delete or role references are removed in users and permissions.
- Implement Rolechecker Middelware:
    - Checks if the user has at least one role, that is listed in the Permissions Section of the contenttype for the requested method
- Fix Issue: Dates cannot be queried, because the `+` sign in a query string is treated as empty space.
- Add idiomatic Endpoints for common getters and setters like: Set title, set username set names, set password...
- Edit README with Role-Endpoints, contenttype PATCH endpoint and Permission-Management
- Issue: *standard_init_linux.go:219: exec user process caused: no such file or directory* on `docker-compose up` when using the :latest image created by workflow [CI](https://github.com/D-Bald/fiber-backend/blob/main/.github/workflows/dockerhub.yml) on GitHub Actions => workflow currently disabled and a locally on an ubuntu server built image is used in the [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/D-Bald/fiber-backend/blob/ee64c31317c3ccdd0b75b9ed90117d2b09207efe/docker-compose.yaml#L50).
- Implement file upload
- Validate field_schema on content entry creation (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/schema-validation/)
